# TinyPascal

A collection of Pascal interpreters written in various programming languages. This is based off the **excellent** blog series [Let's Build a Simple Interpreter](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/) by Ruslan Spivak.

There will be as many folders as the programming languages in which the Pascal interpreter is reimplemented implemented. Each folder is named after the programming language of implementation.

Ruslan's original implementation is in Python. On my part, I intend reimplementing `TinyPascal` in Rust, TypeScript, Ruby, C# and Haskell. Besides Python and C#, which I'm quite proficient with, I'd get to learn and use all other languages I've mentioned.
